## Home
Configuration files for sharing and synchronizing across multiple machines.

### Usage
This repo is intended to be directly placed in the home directory and allow easy configuration changes to be sent across devices. By storing the configurations in the repo, it allows for easy propagation from one device to others. The repo includes `.install` and `README.md` but these files are not installed into the home directory.   

### Installation
1. Download files from [repo](https://github.com/nagyj2/home).
2. Enter repository root directory.
3. Execute `./.install`
